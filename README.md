## Problem Statement

Create a simple library management system that allows users to perform basic operations such as adding books, borrowing books, returning books, and viewing available books.

## Requirements

### Add Books:

- Users should be able to add new books to the library.
- Each book should have a unique identifier (e.g., ISBN), title, author, and publication year.

### Borrow Books:

- Users should be able to borrow a book from the library.
- The system should ensure that the book is available before allowing it to be borrowed.
- If the book is not available, the system should raise an appropriate error.

### Return Books:

- Users should be able to return a borrowed book.
- The system should update the availability of the book accordingly.

### View Available Books:

- Users should be able to view a list of all available books in the library.

## Solution
The project is developed using Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles and follows clean coding practices.

## Features

1. **Add Book:** Allows adding new books with unique identifiers (ISBN), title, author, and publication year.
2. **Borrow Book:** Enables borrowing books if available, with error handling if the book is already borrowed or does not exist.
3. **Return Book:** Allows users to return borrowed books and updates their availability status.
4. **View Available Books:** Displays all books currently available in the library.

## Prerequisites

- Python installed
- Git installed

## Setup Instructions

**Clone the Repository:**
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Raxit910/LMS.git
   cd LMS 
```
**Run Unit Tests**
To ensure all functionalities are working as expected, run the following command:
```bash
   python -m unittest discover
```
## Test Results
After running the tests, you should see a output like this:

## Test Report
The test report is generated by running the unit tests. You can save the results to a file using:
```bash
   python -m unittest discover -v > test_report.txt
```
